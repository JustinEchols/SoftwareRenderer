// NOTE(Justin): For scan conversion rasterization, the shape that is to
// be drawn is defined by the set of min/max x values in the scan buffer.
// As well as the the starting and ending y values (the number of scanlines).
//
// E.g. Suppose we want to draw a square. The minimum and maximum values for
// each entry in the scan buffer are constants. That is, if we wanted to draw a square
// at the bottom left corner that is 100 pixels wide, then for each entry in 
// the scan buffer, the minimum is always 0 and the maximum is always 99. Furthermore, 
// for the shape to actually be a square, the number of scanlines would be 100.
// As we would have 100 scanlines and each scanline is 100 pixels wide. So,
// the dimensions are 100 by 100. 
//
// Other shapes are defined by variying entries in the scan buffer, according
// to the desired geometry. 


//
// NOTE(Justin) Transformations. As of right now Barycentric
// coordinates are not implemented. Each of the transformations
// below is applied to the position vectors of the three
// vertices of the triangle. This works for translations of a
// triangle but not for rotations or scaling transformations. 
// Scaling the position vectors of the three vertices produces a
// shift. Rotating the position vectors of the three vertices
// will produce a rotation of the trignle. However each vertex
// will rotate by a different amount based off the length of the
// position vector. 
//

// NOTE(Justin): We apply any rigid body transformations to
// the triangle itself. After applying the transformations
// we obtain a copy of the triangle then apply the viewing
// transformations and finally the w divide to the
// copy. If we apply the viewing transformations and
// w divide to the orignal triangle we can no
// longer use the data of the triangle unless we undo the
// w divide and viewing transformation to convert
// the triangle data back to the proper space. So it is easy
// to just obtain a copy of the triagnle and apply the
// viewing and division operations on the triangle and copy
// this data to the frame buffer. This is the reason for
// creating the triagnle called Fragment.

//
// NOTE(Justin): Update camera transform. Only need to do this
// whenever a switch happens. Not every frame. TODO(Justin): Fix
// this so that we do it only whenver a change happens. Do it
// inside the if-else block app_input logic? Or just count the
// button presses. That is enough information to determine
// whether or not there exists a need to switch cameras. If so
// then can check which camera, if not skip 
//
// // if width height of back buffer changed
// //	create new screen space map.
