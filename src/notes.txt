// NOTE(Justin): For scan conversion rasterization, the shape that is to
// be drawn is defined by the set of min/max x values in the scan buffer.
// As well as the the starting and ending y values (the number of scanlines).
//
// E.g. Suppose we want to draw a square. The minimum and maximum values for
// each entry in the scan buffer are constants. That is, if we wanted to draw a square
// at the bottom left corner that is 100 pixels wide, then for each entry in 
// the scan buffer, the minimum is always 0 and the maximum is always 99. Furthermore, 
// for the shape to actually be a square, the number of scanlines would be 100.
// As we would have 100 scanlines and each scanline is 100 pixels wide. So,
// the dimensions are 100 by 100. 
//
// Other shapes are defined by variying entries in the scan buffer, according
// to the desired geometry.
