## Compiling
To compile enable the MSVC command line tools by calling misc/shell.bat in an windows terminal. Then navigate to the source directory and call the build script.

\src> ..\misc\shell.bat
\src> build.bat

## Controls
Use WASD to move up, left, down, and right. To move in and out, use up arrow and down arrow, respectively. There are three virtual cameras. To switch between them press 1, 2, or 3.
